<h3>Working out is like tearing down and rebuilding a structure, nutrients are the building blocks, and your diet is the blueprint. Missing nutrients and diet, you are left with ruins</h3>
<p>The most important part about weight training is diet; everything that you eat defines who you are. If you hit the gym everyday but eat like shit or don't eat
    anything at all, no matter how much effort you dedicate at the gym, it will all go to waste.
</p>
<p>Dieting can be very confusing and difficult to understand, but as you are getting more experienced, it will be second nature to you. First, I will explain the fundamentals
  of nutrition, then I will dive into the basics of dieting. Finally, I will talk about some dieting strategies that helped me lose weight.
</p>
<h2>Nutrition Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The most important part about nutrition is the macronutrients, which consist of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. These 3 are the most critical building blocks for your workout journey, and I will explain
    what each does and how they are beneficial. I won't go into details about the micronutrients, such as vitamins and omega-3, because even though they are important, most people have a sufficient amount of them.
</p>
<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
<p>Carbs (short for carbohydrates) are your body's main source of energy. They break down into glucose, which your body uses for fuel,
    especially during workouts. If you don't eat enough carbs, your body might start breaking down muscle for energy, and we don't want that.
 </p>
 <p>
    There are two main types: simple and complex. Simple carbs are the fast-digesting kind—like sugar, candy, fruit, or soda. They give you quick energy but burn out fast.
    Complex carbs are stuff like rice, oats, pasta, and potatoes. These digest more slowly, keep you full longer, and give you steady energy.
 </p>
 <p>
    When you hit the gym, your body mainly uses something called glycogen, which is just stored carbs in your muscles and liver.
    That's why carbs are so important—if your glycogen is low, your workouts will feel like garbage, and you won't lift as strongly.
    Also, carbs help with recovery. After lifting, eating carbs helps refill your glycogen so you're ready for your next workout.
    Don't skip them. Carbs don't make you fat—eating too much of anything does. Just choose better sources like fruits, veggies, rice, potatoes, and oats instead of loading up on junk.
 </p>
 <p> I like to eat complex or slow carbs like oatmeal an hour before a workout. If I am short on time, I will eat simple carbs like white rice instead. It's suggested that consuming complex carbs before the gym and
    Simple carbs right after the gym help performance and recovery.

 <h2>Fats</h2>
 <p>Fats, sounds like the devil if you are trying to lose weight, but it's super important.
    Your body needs fat to survive—it helps with hormone production (like testosterone, which is huge for muscle growth),
    supports brain function, and helps you absorb vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Remember, everything in moderation is good.
</p>
<p>
    There are a few types of fat. You've got healthy fats like the ones in eggs, avocado, nuts, olive oil, and fatty fish.
    Then there are the not-so-great ones, like trans fats found in processed junk and fried food.
    Those are the ones you want to limit, but you don't need to avoid fat altogether. When you are on a weightloss journey, you can lower fat intake to 1g of fat
    per bodyweight(kg) anything lower will screw up your hormones that means lower energy, bad mood, and possibly slower gains.
</p>
<p>
    Fat also keeps you full longer than carbs do, which helps if you're trying to stay on track with your diet. Just remember that fat has more calories per gram (9 calories vs. 4 in carbs and protein), so it adds up fast. That doesn't mean fat is bad—it just means you gotta portion it smart. So yeah, don't fear fat.
    Just stick to the good kinds and make sure it's part of a balanced diet. You're not gonna get jacked living off protein shakes and rice alone.

<h2>Proteins</h2>
<p>
    If you're not getting enough protein, you're wasting your workouts. You'll still be sore, but your body won't have the material it needs to recover and grow. So yeah, protein is a must if you want results.
     Good sources of protein include stuff like chicken, beef, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shakes, tofu, and beans. Aim to spread it throughout your meals instead of eating it all at once—your body can only use so much at a time.
</p>
<p>
    How much should you eat? A good rule of thumb is around 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.
    So if you weigh 160 lbs, try to get at least 120-160 grams a day.
    However, if you are overweight, say 250lb, ain't no way you'll need 250g of protein every day, that's way too much. Instead
    I like to do 1 gram of protein per pound of <b>target</b> body weight. For example, if you are currently 250 lb and want to weigh 200 lb, then eat 200g of protein a day.
    Remember, this method works if you have a decent amount of belly fat; if you are tall and only carry a bit of belly fat, then just eating at your current body weight of protein would be fine.
    Sounds like a lot, but it's doable once you plan it out.

<h2>Calories In, Calories Out</h2>
<p>The most important part about dieting, whether you are trying to lose weight or gain weight, is all about calories. Sure, a healthy diet will help you
    stay healthy, but eating too much will also make you gain weight. The opposite also works; if you eat at a calorie deficit, even if you are eating McDonald's every day, you
    will still lose weight. Those who claim that they can gain weight by drinking water every day have no idea what they are talking about. The law of Conservation of Energy states that
    energy cannot be created or destroyed. Water has no calories, so you must have been getting those calories from somewhere else. The first step to gain weight or lose weight is to quit lying.
    With this idea in mind, let's dive into the basics regarding calories.
</p>
<h2>Calories Basics</h2>
<p>You can see calories as gas for a car; without calories, the car won't run, and you will die. Too many calories will cause the cart to be heavy, which slows down the vehicle. The human body is much more complex than this,
    if your car have a full tank, then it might take days or weeks before you need a refill, but your body is constantly burning calories, this is called BMR or basal metabolic rate, the BMR represents
    the minimum amount of calories your body needs to stay alive. Activity such as breathing, making your heart beat, basically anything to make you stay alive, costs calories. TDEE, which stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure, is the
    amount of calories that your body burns every day to keep you the same weight. BMR varies based on the individual, such as your age, height, weight, and sex. TDEE, on the other hand, varies based on your activity level. Keep in mind that TDEE
    is based on BMR; the formula is BMR x your activity level = TDEE. If you want to lose weight, then you can calculate your current TDEE and eat 500 calories below that amount. If you want to gain weight, you need to eat an extra 500 calories every day.
    Of course, you can eat more or less than 500 calories. I'd recommend 500 just for consistency and health.
</p>
<h3>I have created a TDEE and BMR calculator below for you guys to get an estimated amount of calories you need every day </h3>
<p>A pound of fat is equivalent to 3,500 calories, so if you have a deficit of 500 calories every day for a whole week, then you can expect to lose a pound of fat per week.
    It might be tempting to go for a bigger deficit than that, but keep in mind that your body is very efficient.
    If you're in too big of a deficit, your body will start cutting expenses--your muscles.
    And if you lose too much muscle, you'll burn fewer calories than expected. As a result,
    it will be harder for you to lose weight, and you may end up skinny-fat. If you are obese or very overweight,
    then you can take a 1,000-calorie deficit per day for a couple of weeks, but slowly, you should transition to a 500-calorie deficit.
     For weight gain, if you are bone skinny, then honestly, just eat as much as you can. But do keep in mind that a lot of the extra calories will convert to fat.
     A 500-calorie surplus will keep a better balance between fat gain and muscle gain. Remember: it's harder to gain muscle than to lose fat, so aim for muscle first, then cut the fat later.
</p>
<p>If you want to gain muscle, staying in a calorie deficit will only take you so far. When you start working out, you might gain a decent amount from newbie gains, but once the beginner phase ends, you'll hit a stalemate.
    That's when you have to decide whether you want to gain more muscle by eating at a surplus, or keep the deficiency, but make no real gains. <b>Remember:</b>
    If you have no muscle underneath the fat, you'll have nothing left once the fat is gone. Focus on muscle gain first, and then you'll be on your way to achieving that dream physique!

<p><strong>Note: </strong>if you walk around 2000 steps a day but also hit the gym consistently(3-5 times a week), then I would place yourself in the
light or moderately active category. You don't burn a lot of calories lifting weights; a typical dedicated gym session burns around 200 - 300 calories, 
and this is assuming you are going hard. Unless you play sports, then don't pick the highly or extremely active level. I would recommend start with sedentary and go with a slight deficit 
then record your weight every day for a month, take the mean value from each week and you will get an accurate weekly weight rate.</p>
<br>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>I am a strong believer that different people have their diet plan that will work and can <b>stick with</b>, since the only thing that matters,
    As mentioned before, it is a consistent calorie deficit or surplus. You can choose to eat anything as long as it meets your calorie requirement.
    However, certain diet plans make this process easier. I have had the most success with a carb cycle diet. Unlike a typical keto diet, carb cycling puts your body into a very short period of ketosis before boosting back.
    This way, you can satisfy your cravings for carbs and place the heavy carb refill days on the toughest days, such as leg days.</p>
<h3>Carb Cycle</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Day 1-2: Low carb day</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Carb: Aim for 1g of carb per body weight(kg)</li>
        <li>Protein: aim for 1g per pound of body weight(if you are slightly overweight) if not please see protein section</li>
        <li>Fat: Fill the rest of the calories with healthy fats</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Day 3: Heavy Carb Day</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Carb: 2 to 3 times body weight can be more if desired</li>
        <li>Protein: Can stick to low-carb day or can do slightly lower</li>
        <li>Fats: 0.5-1g per body weight in kg</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Then you repeat</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros/Cons of carb cycle</h3>
<p><b>Pros: </b>Carb cycling helps reduce food craving as foods that contain protein and fat are typically fulfilling. It is very easy to hit protein goals on low-carb days. High-carb days help refill glycogen in the muscles
which boosts gym performance. For a low-carb day, I typically save carb intake before and after workouts. Meanwhile for high carb day I love eating a shit ton of carbs to satisfy my craving. This plan has helped me lose the most weight comfortably.</p>
<p><b>Cons: </b>Lower performance in the gym. I have experienced more fatigue and weaker lifts when I'm on this diet plan; the weight is dropping, which might be a contributing factor. Overall, this plan is great if you love eating fat and protein and don't mind eating less carbs</p>


<p>The oldest and the longest diet plan I have followed was to simply track my protein and calories, no matter what I eat. It has proven to be successful, but often I find myself in constant hunger or cravings. There are thousands of diet plans online that you can follow.
    All of them are about calories; there is no magic behind them.
</p>
<h3>Some strategies I have used to "save" calories</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Chicken breast</b>: ultimate gym food, dry af but does the job, cheap and full of protein. Don't skim on seasoning, otherwise you will lose sanity</li>
    <li><b>Low calorie sauces</b>: a lot of sauces have low calorie or no calories at all, such as hot sauce, A1, and sriracha sauce. Sauces often contain lots of calorie so check your sauces!</li>
    <li><b>Keto bread</b>: I was surprised to find it; they are very low in calories and high in protein. Combine it with low-calorie jams, they are very fulfilling; however, they don't taste as good as regular bread</li>
    <li><b>Fat free stuff: </b> A lot of fat-free food is low in calories, such as fat-free cheese, fat-free milk, and sliced meats</li>
    <li><b>Zero sugar sodas: </b>Greatest human invention, and honestly, they taste just like regular soda but without the extra calories, there's a whole selection of them, and your favorite soda probably has a zero sugar version.</li>
    <li><b>Oatmeals: </b>Extremely satiating, I often eat half a cup to a cup before gym, I have a big stomach, so if I'm full after a cup of oatmeal, you should be fine too!</li>
    <li><b>Potatoes and others: </b> Potatoes are very satiating, they contain loads of carbs, and they are complex carbs which take longer to digest, same goes for sweet potato, ya, and taros</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on a bulk, then just eat anything that has high calories, just do the complete opposite of what the save calorie list suggests, eat whole fat food, high calorie sauces, and drink high calorie beverages.</p>
<h3>Ultimate weight gain hack is to <b>GOMAD!!!!</b></h3>
<p>GOMAD stands for "Gallon Of Milk A Day." No joke, if you are not lactose intolerant, just drink milk and your weight will skyrocket. I'm not talking about a cup a day, I'm talking about half a gallon to a gallon per day! Milk is very nutritious; it contains lots of fat and protein. Chocolate milk will do the trick if you
    find regular milk boring.</p>
<h3>READ THE NUTRITION FACT LABEL!!!</h3>
<p>It is crucial to learn how to read nutrition fact labels. I will be using the example below to guide you.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, look at the serving size. If you see 100 calories on a snack, it might not mean that the snack only contains 100 calories. Most of the time, the serving size would be something like 1/4 or 1/2, which means 1/4 of the snack is worth
    100 calories, that means the whole snack is 400 calories total! So always pay attention to the serving size before anything.
</li>
<li>Second, you look at the calories, this is straightforward, then calculate the total calories the food contains based on its serving size</li>
<li>Third, look at the nutritional content. If the snack is only 100 calories but is made of 10 grams of fat, if you are on a cut, then it might not be wise to "waste those calories"</li>
<ul>
    <li>Remember: 1 gram of protein is worth 4 calories, 1 gram of carbohydrate is worth 4 calories, and 1 gram of fat is 9 calories</li>
</ul>
<li>Some food labels their brand ultra low calorie, ie, but if you look at their nutrition fact, the numbers don't add up. Let's say the food is labeled 100 calories but contains 20 grams of fat, even if we ignore the carbs and protein it contains.
    20 x 9 = 180 calories.
</li>
<li>Another thing to pay attention to is saturated fat, as explained in the fats section. Saturated fat is the "bad guy."Trans fats are the ultimate villain you want to avoid, and saturated fats are the good guys. You want to avoid the bad fat as much as possible.</li>
<li> I don't pay attention to the cholesterol section or the sodium section, but it's always good to avoid high cholesterol and sodium food</li>
<li>For the carbohydrate section, you would want to avoid added sugar as they are simple sugars that will spike your insulin, make you feel tired and sleepy. Dietary fiber, on the other hand, nd is great,
    most of them barely have any calories, so if you buy artificial sweeteners like stevia, it might say 12 g of carbs, but the label claims 0 calories, as they aren't wrong. It's just that dietary fiber cannot be processed by our bodies.
    The calories it contributes cancel out, since our body needs calories to process them.
</li>
<li>At last, the protein section, extremely straightforward, this is how you can calculate how much protein you consume the easiest, since it tells you the exact amount</li>
<li>There is a micronutrients section, but I won't go into details regarding that; most of the time, as long as you are eating healthy, you shouldn't have a deficiency. The daily value category is not that helpful if you track your macros, so just ignore it.</li>
</ul>
