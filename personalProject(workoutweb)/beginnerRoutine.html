    <h3>Keep in mind that everyone at the gym has their own insecurity and problems. No one would laugh at you!</h3>
    <p>I want to start off by telling you the harsh reality, that no one give a fuck about you and it is especially true in the gym. 
        You might think that the guy who bench 3 plates would laugh at you when you are dying benching the bar since he has been staring at you for the 
        past 3 minutes. Truth is, he might have been zoomed out and was just staring into the void, or he was just making sure that you won't die under the bar.
        So many has been frightened by the idea of going to a gym because they have no clue where to start and don't want to look like a dumbass. I have been there, 
        and still, till this day, look like a dumbass sometimes when trying out new movements or machines. Just know that it is part of the process, embrace it! But I am here to guide you
        so you have a general idea on what to do. 

    </p>
    <h3>Note: The program below is a 2 day program dedicated for complete newbie it should be repeated at least twice a week(Ex: Upper,Lower,Rest,Upper,Lower,Rest,Rest), its meant to last 1-2 months just to get you some basic strength. After 1-2 months move onto the Starting Strength program which will be covered below.</h2>
    <h3>Upper day</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest press machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Shoulder press machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Cable machine row 3x12</li>
        <li>Lat pulldown machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Tricep push down machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Bicep curl machine 3x12</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The upper day is meant to help you get familar with someone the most straightforward machines in the gym. 3x12 is the set and reps you must follow. Of course you can alternate different movement however you want but you should make sure that you hit each upper 
        body muscle at least once. I did not include that starting weight because that is something you have to figure out yourself. I would suggest starting with a weight that you can do 15-20 reps with and then slowly increase the weight until you can only do 12 reps.
        Make sure you incorporate linear progression, which means you should increase the weight every week. If you can do 12 reps for 3 sets, increase the weight by 5-10 pounds next week. Or you can increase reps by 1-2 every week until you can do 15 reps and then increase the weight.
    </p>
    <h3>Lower day</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leg press machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Leg extension machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Leg curl machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Calf raise machine 3x12</li>
        <li>Abs crunches machine 3x12</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For lower day every movement follows the same principal as explained under upper day, if you are an individual who is over weight then adding 10 minutes of brisk walking before or after workout can be great. However, don't try to force it, and listen to your body. 
        If you are too sore or tired then just call it a day.  
    </p>

    <h2>Novice Rountine</h2>
    <br>
    <p>If you have done the beginner routine for some time and have gained some basic strength, then its time for you to try the novice routine. The novice routine would probably take a while to learn since compound movements are complex and I recommend you 
        to spend a lot of time on perfecting form before adding subsential weight on the bar. It's always good to have a gym buddy who can critique your form, or you can get yourself a tripod to record each session and reflect on your forms. 
        When I started this program, it took me a couple of months before I can finally get the forms right, and even till this day I still have some form issue to correct, don't worry, most lifters including myself will have some form issues, as long as your form is mostly correct and 
        your form won't result in major injuries, then you can proceed with the linear progression. If you felt something is off during or after your gym session don't try to push them. Pause the progression, deload a bit and work on form first. 
        <b>Remember</b>, it might only take you a week or two to get 
        back on track, but it would takes months to heal and recover from an injury. 
    </p>
    <h3>The program below is called Starting Strength, designed by Mark Ripptoe. It is considered as a novice strength training program, the main goal of this program is to set you up for a solid strength foundation. It will not make you look aesthetic or shredded, since to gain strength 
        you must eat at a calorie surplus, you might gain a decent amount of strength even on a deficit when you start the program, you aren't special, it's just the fact that you have never done any proper strength training before. Just believe the process and ignore the belly. Of course, don't eat crazy, 
        a surplus of 500 calories a day should keep you going for a long time. Once you gained a good amoung of strength and put on some muscle, start a cut. I will dive into diet and nutrition in the diet page.
