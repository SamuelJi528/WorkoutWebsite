    <h1>Keep in mind that everyone at the gym has their own insecurity and problems. No one would laugh at you!</h1>
    <h3>I want to start off by telling you the harsh reality, that no one give a fuck about you and it is especially true in the gym. 
        You might think that the guy who bench 3 plates would laugh at you when you are dying benching the bar since he has been staring at you for the 
        past 3 minutes. Truth is, he might have been zoomed out and was just staring into the void, or he was just making sure that you won't die under the bar.
        So many has been frightened by the idea of going to a gym because they have no clue where to start and don't want to look like a dumbass. I have been there, 
        and still, till this day, look like a dumbass sometimes when trying out new movements or machines. Just know that it is part of the process, embrace it! But I am here to guide you
        so you have a general idea on what to do. 
    </h3>
