<h2>Purpose and target audience</h2>
<p>I created this website to help my friends start their gym journey and provide guidance so they don't have to ask me every day. It's also a great way for me to practice my programming skills and publish it on GitHub.
    This site is mainly for beginner lifters who have little to no knowledge about lifting. However, I've also included content for novice and intermediate lifters. 
    Personally, I consider myself an intermediate lifter, so if you're an advanced lifter, this probably isn't for you.</p>
    My goal is to share everything I know about lifting. Of course, don't take everything as absolute truth—I'm not a competitive bodybuilder, and everyone is different.
     However, I believe these knowledge can save you months, or even years, of trial and error.
    <h4>There are links above that you can click to navigate base on your interest and lifting experience</h4>

<h2>What will be covered:</h2>
<p>First, I'll go over basic gym terms so you don't get confused when we talk about diet and workouts. Then, I'll cover different diets and some supplements you might need. 
    Finally, I'll break down workout routines for different levels, like beginner, novice, and intermediate. </p>

<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>I've been lifting since 8th grade, but for all that time, I was on arm curl machine, going on and off without really knowing much about a proper routine.
     I essentially wasted all that time and gained little because my workouts were inconsistent and inefficient. A friend introduced me to compound movements and a book called Starting Strength and things started to change.
     I was 19 years old at the time, and it took me about six months to learn the movements properly. Then, I spent another six months bulking, even though I was overweight. After that, it took a full year to cut down from 203 pounds to 160 pounds
    </p>
     <p>I've made a lot of mistakes during my workout journey. In my first year of serious training, I had two injuries that set me back about four months combined. During my cut, I also slacked off for another four months.
        One thing you should know before committing to your workout goals is that results take time and effort. Life happens, and sometimes we fall off track, but as long as you get back to it and stay consistent, 
        you'll reach your goals. Working out isn't a one-time achievement—it's a lifelong commitment. If you quit for half a year, you'll lose most of your progress and look like you've never been to the gym. 
        That's why consistency and long-term dedication are key.
    </p>
<h2>Enjoy your workouts and believe that you can achieve that dream physique!</h2>
