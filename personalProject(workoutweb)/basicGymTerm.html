<h3>This is where I will introduce various gym terminologies, workout splits and gym etiquette</h3>
<body>
    <h3>First off, basic terminologies and concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rep</b>: stands for repetition meaning how many repetition of that particular exercise you will do</li>
        <li><b>Set</b>: Set is often combined with reps, such as 3 sets of 10, which means you will have to complete 10 repetitions at a time and repeat 3 times. Often we will take short breaks between sets.</li>
        <li><b>"A plate"</b>: often a plate represents 45lb plates, if I tell you to put a plate I don't mean a 10 pound plate</li>
        <li><b>Note: </b>A striaght lifitng bar often weights 45lb, so if I say I can bench 135lb it would be a plate on each side plus the bar</li>
        <li><b>"PR"</b> are short for Personal Record, mostly used for compound movements like Squat,Bench and Deadlifts. Basically it is a weight that an individual can do a repetition on, for example, my PR for bench is 225lb </li>
        <li><b>Spotting</b>: Usually for bench, if you think you might die from benching a certain weight, ask the biggest guy near you for a spot.
            A spotter is basically someone who would prevent you from dying under the bar so don't be shy asking for one. </li>
        <li><b>SBD</b>: Short for Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift. Mostly used for strength measurement and often is called the "Big Three."</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Now.... gym etiquette</h3>
    <p>Honestly no one really cover this, but I believe this is one of the most crucial thing that all beginner should understand.
        No one will look down on you if you look like you have no clue what you are doing, people are minding their own business no one will mock you
        so don't let that stop you from going to the gym. Ask for help and you might find some great advice and a potential gym buddy. HOWEVER, if your gym etiquette sucks 
        people will literally watch you die on the bench(At least I will). </p>
        <p><b>UNRACK YOUR WEIGHTS AFTER YOU ARE DONE!!!</b> I don't care if you can squat or bench 1000 pounds, unrack your weight. Sure, for machines you can leave a plate on but for free weight bars 
        unload everything. If you need help, go ask the 60 year old janitor lady for help.</p>
        <p>Clean the equipment after you are done with it. No one wants to touch your sweat so go grab a paper towel, wet it and mop the thing. I would also suggest you do wipe the equipment before you
            use it, since you never know who used it before and they might have some skin condition. 
        </p>
        <p>If someone ask you for a spot on the bench. <b>DO NOT TOUCH THE BAR</b> unless the bar is going down(during which they are trying to push the weight up), even if they stall for 3 seconds as long as it is not going down you do not touch it</p>
        <p>If you are taking a break between sets, don't go braindead scrolling TikTok forever when there is a line waiting. I am not suggesting that you jump into your next set when you are huffing and puffing. For compound movements you can take 
            as long as you need to recover. For isolates such as machines, keep them between 1-2 minues max.</p>
        <p>Don't take all the weights. This happens mostly for dumbbells, you don't need to do supersets as a beginner. Basically, don't take 4 different weights and hover forever
            you most likely just need 2 different weight max.
        </p>
<h2>Compound vs Isolate movements</h2>
    <p>As you might have noticed, I have been emphasizing isolate movements and compound movements repeatedly. What are they? </p>
     <h2>Compound movements</h2>
     <p>Compound movements refers to movements that require more than one muscle group to be engaged during a workout. Common compound movements are squat, bench press, deadlift and overhead press. 
        No doubt that other movements such as a machine bench press or a lat pull down machine also utilize other muscle groups other than the main muscle. However, compound movements often engage the 
        whole body during a workout session. For example, bench press seems like an isolate movement since you are only pushing the weight up with your chest right? Wrong! The bench press incorporates 
        your chest, tricep, bicep, lats, abs, shoulders, traps and your legs. If you are only using your chest for bench, you will have a very hard time gaining strength from it and potentially increase chance of injuries.
        Since compound movements workout multiple muscle groups at a time, I would strongly advocate beginners to practice them, maybe you need to use machines to gain some basic strength, but the compound movements would lead you
        to your dream physique faster. </p>

    <h2>Isolate movements</h2>
    <p> Isolate movements are often done on machines as opposed to free bar like the compound movements. The point of isolate movements is to target specific muscle group and avoid other muscle taking over. For example, the preacher curl and leg extension machines.
        At this point you might wonder, if compound movements basically covers all muscle group, why should we bother with isolate movements then?
        I was thinking of the same thing during my novice phase. I was doing only SBD until I got injured. I was repping 300lb squats but my biceps were too weak to handle them. 
        Isolate movements are crucial once you step into the intermediate phase. As your big muscle groups are pretty developed but some muscle groups might be lacking which will drag you behind from progressing further.
        I would not advice beginner to have majority of their workouts to be isolate movements, I have done it myself and barely see any gains. Use isolate movements to gain some basic strength and then hop on compound movements.

   <h3>As a beginner you have a lot of potentials. Imagine yourself as a marble stone, compound movements will gain you size and tone you a little bit. However, it will give you the shape but you might be lacking the details. Isolate movements are chisels your use to carve out the details. 
    If you start as a little marble stone and only focus on the details, you'll end up as a little souvenir. Focusing on size and details later you will have that greek god physique.
